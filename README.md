# D√ºr√ºm üåØ

D√ºr√ºm (Turkish for wraps, as in food) is an HTTP wrapper for Scala.

It helps generalize the behavior of handling an HTTP request in a server application. D√ºr√ºm provides abstractions for common operations like logging, timing, authorization etc. It has no external dependency and expects you to provide concrete implementations for the operations it supports.

More documentation and examples are coming very soon.
